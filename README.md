# Row Jam Brough
### A Rock, Paper, Scissors Broughlike
This is based on the Javascript Broughlike Tutorial at https://nluqo.github.io/broughlike-tutorial/index.html.

### Controls
WASD to move. Number keys to cast spells. Space to cycle forms (rock, paper, scissors). 't' to trade life for a new spell. Mouse hover over spells to see a description. 'i' for info screen.

## Development Log
Source Code available at https://github.com/nuzcraft/row-jam-bow

### v1.0 "Release"
Fully revamped graphics!
- special thanks to Quale for their sprites!
- updated the engine to handle a different spritesheet layout
- fixed a few  minor bugs
- added an info screen (press 'i')

### v0.3 "Collaboration"
- special thanks to Felipe Brunetti (@felipebrunetti94) for their pull requests!
- special thanks to Leonardo Negreiros de Oliveira (@negreirosleo) for their QA work!
- updated enemy progression (can now hit level 10)
- tougher enemies should only appear at later levels
- 'anti' enemies will spawn a normal monster when they die (similar to when you pick up a coin)
- player sprite changes with the different forms
- spell descriptions are shown when you hover your mouse over the spell side of the screen
- there is a new option to trade life (2 whole hearts!!) for a new spell. If you are full on spells, this will be a new slot, else it will fill an empty slot.

Basic shell from Super Turtle Man. Changes:
